## Key Demo Script

### Opening (1 minute)
"Good [morning/afternoon]. I'm excited to present our Creative Automation Pipeline solution that addresses the critical challenge of scaling social media campaign production while maintaining brand consistency and quality."

### Business Context (4 minutes)
"Global consumer goods companies are struggling with:
- **Manual bottlenecks**: 2-3 weeks to produce campaign variants
- **Quality inconsistency**: Decentralized creative processes
- **Resource drain**: Skilled teams focused on repetitive tasks
- **Scale limitations**: Can't support hundreds of monthly campaigns

Our solution delivers:
- **10x faster production**: From weeks to hours
- **Consistent quality**: Automated brand compliance
- **Cost reduction**: 60% lower production costs
- **Scalable operations**: Support for 500+ campaigns monthly"

### Technical Architecture (8 minutes)
"Let me walk you through our technical approach:

**1. Campaign Brief Processing**
- JSON/YAML input with product details, target audience, messaging
- Validation and enrichment of campaign requirements
- Support for multiple products and aspect ratios

**2. AI-Powered Asset Generation**
- Integration with OpenAI DALL-E for high-quality product images
- Fallback systems for reliability (mock images, simple graphics)
- Context-aware prompting based on product and campaign details

**3. Template Engine & Brand Compliance**
- Automated application of brand guidelines
- Text overlay with campaign messaging
- Quality scoring and validation

**4. Multi-Format Output**
- Support for all major social platforms (Instagram, TikTok, YouTube, etc.)
- Automated resizing and optimization
- Organized output structure for easy campaign management"

### Live Demonstration (12 minutes)
"Now let me show you the system in action:

**Step 1: Generate Example Campaign Briefs**
```bash
python src/pipeline/main.py example
```

**Step 2: Process Tech Campaign**
```bash
python src/pipeline/main.py generate -b examples/tech_campaign.json -o output -v
```

**Step 3: Show Generated Outputs**
- Navigate to output directory
- Show organized folder structure
- Display generated creatives for different aspect ratios
- Review quality scores and metadata

**Step 4: Analyze Results**
```bash
python src/pipeline/main.py analyze -o output
```

**Key Points to Highlight:**
- Clean, organized output structure
- Quality scores for each creative
- Performance metrics and success rates
- Error handling and fallback mechanisms"

### Monitoring & Intelligence (3 minutes)
"Our AI-driven monitoring system provides:
