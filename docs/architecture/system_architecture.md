# Creative Automation Pipeline - System Architecture

## High-Level Architecture Overview

The Creative Automation Pipeline is designed as a microservices-based architecture that enables scalable, automated generation of social media campaign assets. The system consists of several key components working together to process campaign briefs, generate assets, and manage the creative workflow.

## System Components

### 1. Campaign Brief Ingestion Layer
- **Campaign Brief API**: RESTful API for receiving campaign briefs in JSON/YAML format
- **Brief Validator**: Validates campaign brief structure and required fields
- **Queue Manager**: Manages campaign processing queue with priority handling

### 2. Asset Management Layer
- **Asset Storage**: Cloud storage (Azure Blob/AWS S3) for input and generated assets
- **Asset Registry**: Database tracking asset metadata, versions, and relationships
- **Asset Processor**: Handles asset format conversion, resizing, and optimization

### 3. AI/ML Generation Layer
- **GenAI Service**: Integration with multiple AI providers (OpenAI DALL-E, Midjourney, Stable Diffusion)
- **Image Generator**: Generates hero images and product visuals
- **Text Generator**: Creates localized campaign messages and copy
- **Style Transfer**: Applies brand guidelines and style consistency

### 4. Creative Pipeline Engine
- **Template Engine**: Manages creative templates for different aspect ratios
- **Layout Generator**: Automatically arranges assets according to brand guidelines
- **Text Overlay**: Adds campaign messages with proper typography
- **Quality Checker**: Validates brand compliance and content appropriateness

### 5. Output Management
- **Format Converter**: Generates assets in multiple formats (PNG, JPG, MP4)
- **Aspect Ratio Generator**: Creates variations for 1:1, 9:16, 16:9 ratios
- **Batch Processor**: Handles bulk generation for multiple campaigns
- **Delivery System**: Organizes outputs by product and campaign

### 6. Monitoring & Analytics
- **Agent System**: AI-driven monitoring of pipeline health and performance
- **Alert Manager**: Sends notifications for failures, delays, or issues
- **Analytics Engine**: Tracks generation metrics and performance
- **Reporting Dashboard**: Provides insights on campaign generation success

## Data Flow

```
Campaign Brief → Validation → Queue → Asset Check → AI Generation → 
Creative Assembly → Quality Check → Output Generation → Storage → Delivery
```

## Technology Stack

- **Backend**: Python with FastAPI
- **AI Services**: OpenAI API, Hugging Face, Custom ML models
- **Storage**: Azure Blob Storage / AWS S3
- **Database**: PostgreSQL for metadata, Redis for caching
- **Queue**: Redis/RabbitMQ for job processing
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus + Grafana
- **Containerization**: Docker + Kubernetes

## Security & Compliance

- **API Authentication**: JWT tokens with role-based access
- **Data Encryption**: End-to-end encryption for sensitive campaign data
- **Brand Compliance**: Automated checks for logo presence, color usage
- **Content Moderation**: AI-powered content filtering for inappropriate material
- **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive logging for compliance and debugging

## Scalability Considerations

- **Horizontal Scaling**: Microservices can scale independently
- **Load Balancing**: Multiple instances of generation services
- **Caching**: Redis caching for frequently used assets and templates
- **CDN Integration**: Global content delivery for generated assets
- **Auto-scaling**: Kubernetes HPA based on queue depth and CPU usage
